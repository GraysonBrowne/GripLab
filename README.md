# GripLab

An open-source Python tool for FSAE/Formula Student teams to process and analyze tire test data, fit tire models, and visualize results. The goal is to lower the barrier for students to use TTC data effectively in vehicle simulations by providing clear, accessible tools for data handling and modeling.

---

## Features
- Import TTC and CSV tire test data  
- Process and manipulate datasets (filtering, unit conversions, subsets)  
- 2D and 3D plotting of tire data and fitted models  
- Fit common tire models (e.g., Pacejka, polynomial)  
- Export fitted parameters for use in simulations

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/{yourusername}/GripLab.git
cd GripLab
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
